# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This is the weather-journal app project from udacity.
The project shows the usage of an own local server and the handling with get and post routes as well as asynchronous javascript.
The code was written by ME :-)

## Instructions
Start the local server with `node server.js`.
Then got to `http://localhost:8080/` in the browser.
